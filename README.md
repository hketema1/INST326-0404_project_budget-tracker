# INST326-0404_project_budget-tracker


A command-line Python application to track income and expenses, view summaries, and manage your personal budget. Built as the final group project for INST326.


## Current Features

- `Transaction` class to represent individual financial entries
- `BudgetManager` class to manage and summarize transactions
- File saving and loading via JSON
- Unit tests for transaction data functionality
- All modules include docstrings and inline comments for clarity


## Coming Soon

- Command-line interface (`cli.py`) for interactive user input
- Input validation for transaction types and amounts
- Unit tests for file I/O and budget summaries

## Priority List for the build

1. Get started with file 'cli.py' that runs the command-line menu for user interaction
2. Create unit tests for budget_manager.py - 'test_budget_manager.py'
3. Then create a test unit for cli.py - 'test_cli.py' (Not needed but a plus)
4. Start validation process for transactions.py via JSON to save and load information.
5. Manual test for the entire system.
